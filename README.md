## What is this project ? 

Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It is a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling. 

## Important Note: 

>This app was created by Jai Shah as part of the [Flutter Boot Camp course by London App Brewery](https://github.com/londonappbrewery/Flutter-Course-Resources/). None of the designs and ideas used are not mine and this was only a practise app created while learning.
